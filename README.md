## Project Overview
This project was created for the **FP20 Analytics Challenge 31 (October 2025)**
Educational performance data provides a powerful lens into student achievement, teaching effectiveness, and the impact of the curriculum. By examining assessment results, grades, and progress metrics, schools and educators can gain a deeper understanding of learning trends, identify students at risk, and recognize top achievers. This challenge invites participants to dive deep into a comprehensive dataset that tracks student scores, assessment outcomes, and course results across subjects and time periods. The goal of this dashboard is to provide data-driven insights into student performance and teacher impact. Analyze key trends such as enrollment growth, pass/fail distribution and weighted scores. Help educational administrators make informed decisions for curriculum improvement and resource allocation.
