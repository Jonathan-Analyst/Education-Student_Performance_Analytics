## Project Overview
This project was created for the **FP20 Analytics Challenge 31 (October 2025)**
Educational performance data provides a powerful lens into student achievement, teaching effectiveness, and the impact of the curriculum. By examining assessment results, grades, and progress metrics, schools and educators can gain a deeper understanding of learning trends, identify students at risk, and recognize top achievers. This challenge invites participants to dive deep into a comprehensive dataset that tracks student scores, assessment outcomes, and course results across subjects and time periods. The goal of this dashboard is to provide data-driven insights into student performance and teacher impact. Analyze key trends such as enrollment growth, pass/fail distribution and weighted scores. Help educational administrators make informed decisions for curriculum improvement and resource allocation.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises five main tables:
- `FactPerformance`(Fact Table): Studentsâ€™ academic results, and scores
- `DimStudents` â€“ Student demographic and academic information
-  `DimTeachers` â€“ Teacher profiles and department mapping
-  `DimSubjects` â€“ Subject details with credit units and departmental ownership
-  `DimAssessment` - Assessment details with weighted and max scores
A **Date Table** was created in power BI using DAX to enable yearly, monthly and quaterly trends analysis.
A **Bridge Table** was created to effectively manage many-to-many relationships between the FactPerformance, DimStudents, and DimSubjects tables.

## Dashboard Design
The power BI report consist of three **interactive pages**. It's designed using **ZoomCharts PRO Visuals** for dynamic drill-downs, combined with selected Matrix visuals for detailed-level insights.
